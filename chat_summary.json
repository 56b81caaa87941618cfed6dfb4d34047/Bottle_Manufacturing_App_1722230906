In response, the AI offered a list of potential features related to this button, such as adding a customizable button with animated effects, implementing a pop-up modal for exclusive night-time offers, and integrating social sharing buttons, among others, with certain features already checked as considered. Following this, questions regarding the placement of this button and the action upon interaction were posed, offering options for the user to choose from. \n\nSubsequently, the user requested the addition of a toggle button to switch between two AI models, leading to another set of suggested features including a progress indicator for a bottle creation process and an AI recommendation engine for bottle designs. Additional options for positioning the toggle button and indicating the active AI model were also provided for user selection. \n\nFurthermore, the user asked to change the app's background color to green and yellow, prompting the AI to propose additional features such as a color palette selection tool and the incorporation of a 'Dark Mode' option. Questions were again posed to refine the user's preferences regarding the color scheme and its implementation.\n\nThroughout the conversation, the AI also requested more project details to better understand the user's needs and confirmed the completion of tasks, such as adding buttons and changing background colors, as directed by the user.",
