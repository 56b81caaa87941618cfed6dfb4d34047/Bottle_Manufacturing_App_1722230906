Following this, the user considered incorporating additional features like a color palette selection tool, a 'Dark Mode' option, and preset theme options, while deciding against dynamic background themes and background color transitions/animations. They also contemplated custom background colors, particularly green and yellow, with options either to provide specific shades or have suggestions based on the app's design and branding. The user decided on changing the background color to green and yellow, contemplating whether it should involve a gradient or be in distinct sections. The AI sought further details about the project to better understand the user's requirements and proceed accordingly.",
